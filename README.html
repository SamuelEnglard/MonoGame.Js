<h1>MonoGame.Js</h1>

<p>JavaScript game libary that is based on the XNA/MonoGame API</p>

<p>The only "dependancies" on modern browsers the API takes is the HTML canvas 
object, addEventListener function, and if you want to use Songs and sound 
effects a dependancy on the audio tag too. Otherwise the code is valid 
ECMAScript 3 code and should work fine if canvas and addEventListener are 
pollyfilled.</p>

<p>Clown.html contains a game that is both an example of how to use MonoGame.Js 
and is used as a basic test to make sure it works correctly.</p>

<p>There are places where the API is different in more than just ECMAScript ways 
(so besides making methods start with lowercase letters):</p>

<ul>
<li>To create a Game class to put your own methods on you use the 
Game.createGame(cstr) function which sets up an object for you that you can 
set the prototype of to add instance functions to but inherits from the Game 
class. The function you pass in will be called as the constructor and can use 
this as though it is a constructor.</li>
<li>The initialize, loadContent, contentLoaded, update, draw, unloadContent, and 
exit methods are expected to be "replaced" in your game. To call the Game 
objects base version call base<em>[function name], for example base</em>initialize 
for Game's initialize method.</li>
<li>Because textures are loaded asynchronously you just load content in 
loadContent and then in contentLoaded do any logic based on that content.</li>
<li>You can only load content in loadContent. Trying to load content later will 
result in an exception.</li>
<li>There is no TimeSpan object, instead just plain milliseconds are used. So 
for example instead of gameTime.elapsedGameTime it's
gameTime.elapsedGameMilliseconds.</li>
<li>Remember that Point, Vector2, and Matrix are all copy by ref not copy by 
value.</li>
<li>loadSong and loadSoundEffect both can take an array of urls to allow for 
mutiple encoding formats to help with cross-browser development.</li>
</ul>
